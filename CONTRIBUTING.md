# Contribution Guidelines

Since Laravel Recipes is on github, please submit all issues and pull requests to the [ChuckHeintzelman/laravel-recipes](http://github.com/ChuckHeintzelman/laravel-recipes) repository!

When contributing recipes, please note when the recipe is accepted it will automatically become part of the project and thus follow the Creative Commons Licensing. _Note: not all recipes will be accepted._

If you contribute recipes, please refrain from placing personal information within the recipe itself. Instead submit a pull request to the `docs/contributors.md` document. A simple one line with a link or two in that file is all that is needed.
