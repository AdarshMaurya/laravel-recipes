## Origin Story (and Creative Commons)

I created laravel-recipes.com with the intention of having a site with hundreds of little "how-tos" explaining every aspect of Laravel. From the beginning tasks to more advanced techniques. It was going to be amazing.

And it was.

But I didn't realize how _huge_ an undertaking this would be. I created almost 300 recipes before this realization. After much head-scratching I decided to open this up to the community at large.

I struggled to find the perfect license for this. I looked at GPL and others, but since this site not only contains code but also content that could be used in a variety of mediums. I settled on the Creative Commons license.

Which means you can share, change, adapt laravel-recipes in any way and redistribute in any format, for any purpose (even commercially) as long as you give appropriate credit and share alike.
